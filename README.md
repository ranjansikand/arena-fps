An arena FPS called "So Many Balls" that I made in 3 days for a game jam.

So Many Balls uses projectile-based bullets in a small arena setting, with a high-speed character controller and endless waves of enemies. The objective is simple: kill the enemies and survive. You rack up points as you mow down hordes of enemies, but everything is not what it seems -- the score doesn't seem to matter? Maybe there's a secret to this weird world.

The game consists of two "levels" - an endless arena, and a secret boss fight. Since it was for a game jam, the total playtime is low, but the game is fully playable.
